    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I graduated in 2022 from Hacettepe University, Department of German Translation and Interpreting. Throughout my education and professional experience, I worked on text translation, editing, and quality control in the fields of technical, legal, and media translation. The projects I carried out for companies such as DÜRR, TOGG, Mercedes, BMW, and Enercon enhanced my ability to adapt quickly to different environments and helped me develop an interdisciplinary perspective.</p>

    <p>At present, I am focusing on software and web development. Although I am still new in this field, there is always something new to learn in the world of software, and my curiosity and eagerness to learn are my strongest motivations. I enjoy thinking of coding as solving puzzles and finding solutions by approaching problems from different perspectives. This process allows me to combine both analytical and creative thinking.</p>

    <p>My goals include continuously improving myself, building a strong technical foundation, and one day bringing my own application to life. I am open to learning new technologies, eager to research, and I view the challenges I encounter as opportunities for growth.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I greatly enjoy oil painting, ice skating, and exploring new tastes.</p>
